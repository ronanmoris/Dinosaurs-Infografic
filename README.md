# Udacity's Nanodegree Project 1: Dinosaurs 


## Students should build an Infografic that is derived from data that is provided, as well as user input data.

### Big Picture

For this first project, students have to use Object-oriented Javascript.

Object-oriented javascript is great for working with complex data, but it’s not of much use without an interface to interact with. Infografic will pull in information from a form and use it to complete an array of objects that will then be appended back to the DOM. 

The Infografic consists of a 3x3 grid of tiles (9 in total) with the human in the center tile. Each tile will contain the species, an image, and a fact. For the human tile, you will display the name of the human rather than species and no fact is necessary for the human. When the user clicks to generate the infographic from the form, the grid will appear and the form will be hidden. The facts displayed should be random per dinosaur with an opportunity of displaying at least 6 different types of facts (3 should be from the methods you create). One of the titles should be for a pigeon in which the tile should always display, “All birds are considered dinosaurs.”


### How to run it

Clone or download it by clicking on the green button(Code) on the right upper part of the screen.

### Above and Beyond

If time allows, I will be playing around with some of the recommendations given by Udacity below:

Some ideas might be to validate the form data to ensure the data is acceptable and complete. Allow the user to generate a new infographic. Move the tile colors from CSS to JS for more control. Randomize the order of the tiles while keeping the human in the middle. Create a hover state on the tiles that displays the rest of the species statistics. Create additional methods for comparing data. Rewrite the project to use constructor functions, factory functions, the module pattern, and revealing module pattern. Change out data and images to generate an infographic of your own choosing. Allow the user to select different units for the numbers and update your methods to account for this. Make changes to the CSS, and HTML to make the project your own.
